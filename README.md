# Build a tool to bulk update WordPress plugins in multiple sites with KinstaAPI

This guide walks you through the process of creating a WordPress plugin manager. This tool is designed to efficiently identify all the sites under your Kinsta company account that are utilizing a particular plugin. Once identified, you'll have the flexibility to update this plugin either across all these sites at once or on a site-by-site basis.

## Installation
1. Clone or fork the repository.

## Kinsta Application Hosting Setup
### Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

### Environment Variables
For this tool to work for your company and fetch sites based on your Kinsta account, you need to set the following environment variables in your Kinsta site's environment variables section:

```bash
REACT_APP_KINSTA_COMPANY_ID = 'YOUR_COMPANY_ID'
REACT_APP_KINSTA_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself, and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process based on the `npm start` in the `package.json` as the entry point.

### Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit), the `npm install` and `npm build` commands are run.
